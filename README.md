# Solidity Patterns
A compilation of patterns and best practices for the smart contract programming language Solidity I am compiling. At the moment I am adding the code of patterns on a weekly basis and will add a written description for each pattern in the future.

The patterns already uploaded and assigned to their respective categories are (with more to come):
* Security Patterns
  * Access Restriction
  * Checks Effects Interactions
  * Secure Ether Transfer
  * Emergency Stop
* Behavioral Patterns
  * Oracle
  * Guard Check
  * State Machine
  * Randomness
* Economic Patterns
  * String Equality Comparison
  * Tight Variable Packing
  * Memory Array Building

# Participation
Feel free to review the patterns and write issues for any errors that you find or improvements that you could think of.
