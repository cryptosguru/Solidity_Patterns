# Solidity Patterns
A compilation of patterns and best practices for the smart contract programming language Solidity I have been compiling. At the moment I am adding detailed descriptions to the uploaded patterns:

* Behavioral Patterns
  * Guard Check
  * State Machine
  * Oracle
  * Randomness
* Security Patterns
  * Access Restriction
  * Checks Effects Interactions
  * Secure Ether Transfer
  * Pull over Push
  * Emergency Stop
* Upgradeability Patterns
  * Proxy Delegate
  * Eternal Storage
* Economic Patterns
  * String Equality Comparison
  * Tight Variable Packing
  * Memory Array Building

# Participation
To help me evaluate the patterns, feel free to write issues or pull requests for any improvements you could think of or errors I may have overlooked.
