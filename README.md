# solidity-patterns
A compilation of patterns and best practices for the smart contract programming language Solidity I am compiling. At the moment I am adding the code of patterns on a weekly basis and will add a written description for each pattern in the future.

# Participation
Feel free to review the patterns and write issues for any errors that you find or improvements that you could think of.
